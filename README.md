# pymaceuticals-challenge
Module 5 Challenge

The pymaceuticals.ipynb is my completed notebook submission. It runs without error and generates all of the required output. The outputs match those in the Bootcamp Spot description of the Challenge.

I wrote the code entirely on my own without collaboration or any online AI source (although Google was occasionally helpful for syntax). Several of the methods and techniques we learned in class.

We were also requested to draw some observations or inferences that can be made from the analysis. I put these at the top of the notebook file, as requested in the Challenge description.
